faq:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  conent: FAQ content
  items:
    - title: How long will a new website take?
      content: Generally two weeks at a minimum. As web design requires a lot of back and forwards communication between the designer and the client, the time taken is greatly influenced by how much information you can initially provide, and your availability to communicate. Plan on setting 10 minutes aside every day to respond to emails and answer design/content related questions.
    - title: What do I need to get started?
      content: In order to develop a website that truly meets your needs its very important that you can provide text and photos for the majority of the pages. As our websites are custom-made (we don't just hook up generic templates like some other 'web-designers' do!) its very important that we fully understand what we are working with and design for. We also want to make sure that we are providing you with a polished, ready to go product in the end. Likewise its also very important to have at least a draft of a logo, if that's something that you would want for your business.
    - title: Can we meet via video conferencing online?
      content: Recent advances in video conferencing technologies like Zoom make it much easier for meeting to take place - all you have to do is click a link that will be emailed to you. We conduct our meetings over Zoom as its a common platform that Australian business use and it keeps everyone covid safe. 
    - title: Photographers are expensive, can you provide me with high quality images?
      content: Yes! We source our images from leading stock photography agencies. We charge a low fixed fee per image and you are also provided with a copy of the images so that you can use them for social media posts and marketing. 
    - title: Do your websites work across all devices?
      content: Absolutely! Mobile friendly design is one of the factors that google looks for in determining which websites should come first in their listings. Therefore our websites are coded to work across all screen widths (from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors). The way in which content is displayed will change according to the screen width. This is called responsive design.
    - title: Can I update my website myself?
      content: Yes! We provide a user friendly system for you to log into so that you can change the text and images on your website. Technical support is included in our prices. If you need small, infrequent updates we are happy to do them on your behalf.
    - title: How do you price websites?
      content: We try to give general indications on our website as to the costs for a basic small-business package. After a free consultation we will send you a detailed quote to deliver a website which contains the functionality that you are after. Common factors which affect price are the number of pages, the amount of detail/elements in each page, functionalities including selling products and displaying data and interactive elements. 
    - title: Do you do one page web sites?
      content: Commonly called landing pages and squeeze pages, one page websites are often the right choice for small businesses who are just starting out or don't have enough information for a large multi-page website. We have set this website up to showcase how you can include lots of different information effectively on one page. The advantages are that the user doesn't have to click on links to find what they are after and you can experience higher conversion rates as customers can contact you or sign up to your product without navigating to a new page. 
    - title: What is SEO?
      content: Search Engine Optimisation is a very important consideration for your new website as the majority of traffic to your website will be from organic search engine traffic (people searching for your products or brands). In addition to structuring our code to be search engine friendly we check over your web site content and make suggestions on how to best structure it for search engine results. We submit your website to Google and Bing search engine consoles, and keep a close eye on how your search results are tracking.
